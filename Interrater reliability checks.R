# REVISION PLAN ---------

"In response to the concerns raised here, as well as by Carlsson & Maatman, 
we will enlist the help of another independent reviewer to conduct independent double coding. 
We have identified a suitable reviewer who is willing to do so, and who has not seen the existing ratings. 

We plan to add this reviewer as a co-author at the R&R stage.

This reviewer will be trained on the same two training articles that the initial reviewer (first author) 
and second author used to calibrate responses. They will then go through the data extraction process. 

We will then compare the extracted data to the first reviewerâ€™s data, calculate measurement error and 
report on points of discussion.  We will re-run analyses with the data extracted by the independent reviewer. 

When reporting our findings, we will retain the original codings, and will report on interrater reliability. 
Specifically, we will calculate interrater reliability for each variable rated. 
For dichotomous or other nominal ratings we will use Cohen's kappa, and for the ordinal variables we will use weighted kappa.

Additionally, we would be happy to share a supplemental table with more examples to provide greater detail as 
to how the ratings were determined.
